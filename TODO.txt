X Do not create CommandLineArguments in the Reader.
X centralize serialization options
do not use CompilerCall as the _header_ type in the reader, make ito object or generic and that is the extensibility point for reader versions
maybe raw serialization
need a cross os diagnostic that prints, maybe just put it in the command line only
remove Arguments from CompilerCall, doesen't need to be there in raw form, can make it a helper through the log reader
unit tests that use the old version of compiler logs to guarantee compat
pool the memory stream
